Vector is only as good as it's documentation and education. And while we
put effort into our [docs][pages.docs], we felt there was an educational
aspect missing, so we launched a new [new guides section][pages.guides]. This
section is meant to house high-quality guides that will be maintained and
updated continuously. To kick this new section off we've added the following guides:

{{< jump "/docs/setup/quickstart" >}}
{{< jump "/guides/advanced/custom-aggregations-with-lua" >}}
{{< jump "/guides/advanced/parsing-csv-logs-with-lua" >}}

[pages.docs]: /docs/
[pages.guides]: /guides/
