## Upgrade guide

### Breaking changes

#### Removal of the `socket` source's `tcp` and `unix` mode `max_length` setting {#socket-source-max-length}

In v0.29.0 the `max_length` setting, used by the `tcp` and `unix` modes
of the `socket` source, was marked as deprecated.

That setting was replaced by the `max_length` setting within the `framing`
setting.

Any explicit usages of `max_length` for those modes of the `socket`
source will no longer work and configurations will need to instead use
a `framing` setting in order to set a maximum length.
