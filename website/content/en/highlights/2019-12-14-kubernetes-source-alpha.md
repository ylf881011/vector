We're currently [experimenting with Kubernetes integration](https://github.com/vectordotdev/vector/issues/260)
This functionality is undocumented and not yet ready for general use. However,
we consider it to be at Alpha stage and suitable for adventurous early adopters
to try out.

We consider Kubernetes integration to be extremely important and we want to get
this right, so we'd love to [get feedback][urls.vector_chat] from anyone willing.

The main ticket to follow is [issue #260](https://github.com/vectordotdev/vector/issues/260).
