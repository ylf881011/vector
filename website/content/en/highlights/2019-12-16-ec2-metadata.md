Are your events the laughing-stock of the data warehouse? Then enrich them with
our brand spanking new [`aws_ec2_metadata` transform][docs.transforms.aws_ec2_metadata].

<!--more-->

Configuration isn't complicated, just add and hook up the transform. If you
don't want all enrichments added then white-list them with the `fields` option:

```toml
[transforms.fill_me_up]
  type = "aws_ec2_metadata"
  inputs = ["my-source-id"]
  fields = [
    "instance-id",
    "local-hostname",
    "public-hostname",
    "public-ipv4",
    "ami-id",
    "availability-zone",
    "region",
  ]
```

For more guidance get on the [reference page][docs.transforms.aws_ec2_metadata].
