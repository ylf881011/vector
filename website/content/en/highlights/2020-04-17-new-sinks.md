We all love a good sink. Now you can enjoy our latest offerings:

- [`papertrail` sink][docs.sinks.papertrail]
- [`honeycomb` sink][docs.sinks.honeycomb]
- [`pulsar` sink][docs.sinks.pulsar]
- [`datadog_logs` sink][docs.sinks.datadog_logs]

Expanding support is a fundamental requirement we're aiming to achieve before
hitting [1.0][urls.vector_roadmap].
