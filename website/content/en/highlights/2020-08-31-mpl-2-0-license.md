Vector has switched to the [Mozilla Public License 2.0][urls.mpl_20],
a weak copyleft license used by other popular open-source projects, such as
[Terraform][urls.terraform_license] and [Consul][urls.consul_license].

## Why?

[This excellent article][urls.mpl_20_post] by Julien Ponge describes the license
well, and the [Mozilla MPL 2.0 FAQ][urls.mpl_faq] offers a more in-depth
analysis:

> Like all other free and open source software, software available under the MPL
> is available for anyone (including individuals and companies) to use for any
> purpose. The MPL only creates obligations for you if you want to distribute
> the software outside your organization.

We love open-source, and we feel this license more accurately embodies the
spirit of open-source by requiring _direct_ Vector code changes (not code around
it) to be made in the open. This ensures that the entire Vector community
benefits from changes. A fundamental principle of open-source.

## Does it restrict usage?

No! It is not our intent to restrict Vector usage or distribution in any way,
now or in the future.
