Vector's new home for helm charts is at https://helm.vector.dev!

We made this change as part of migrating the helm charts from our old AWS S3 bucket hosting to
GitHub Pages via [vectordotdev/helm-charts](https://github.com/vectordotdev/helm-charts). This new domain
will also allow us to swap hosting in the future without any user impact.

Vectorâ€™s 0.16.x release will be the last version that publishes charts to both
https://packages.timber.io/helm/latest and https://packages.timber.io/helm/nightly repositories.

The new repository contains all released charts from the previous `latest` repository.
Moving forward we will be releasing charts at their own pace as we work towards the stable
releases for the _vector-agent_ and _vector-aggregator_ charts.

Development and issue tracking will be migrated to https://github.com/vectordotdev/helm-charts
in the coming days.

## Upgrade Guide

The new repository can be added with:

```shell
helm repo add vector https://helm.vector.dev
helm repo update
```

Once added the _vector-agent_ chart can be installed with:

```shell
helm install vector vector/vector-agent \
  --namespace vector \
  --create-namespace \
```

Or upgraded with:

```shell
helm upgrade vector vector/vector-agent \
  --namespace vector \
  --reuse-values
```
