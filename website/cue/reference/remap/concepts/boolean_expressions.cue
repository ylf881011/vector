		In VRL, Boolean [expressions](#expressions) resolve to a single Boolean value (either `true`
		or `false`). Boolean expressions can be of any complexity and have several uses in Vector,
		including specifying conditions for [routing](\(urls.vector_transforms)/route) and
		[filtering](\(urls.vector_transforms)/filter) events.
